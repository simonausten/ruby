|autobiography|

My name and age are still unknown, but I've been feeling very upset lately. Life can feel very overwhelming and tough, and it seems like nothing is going right. One thing that makes me happy is thinking about my favorite soccer team, Manchester United. I love watching them play and talking about them with my friends. School is difficult for me right now, and it's hard to focus. I worry about what kind of person I'm becoming.
